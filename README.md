# Testimonial-Grid-Section
This is a solution to the Testimonial Grid Section challenge on Frontend Mentor. Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects

## The Challenge:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- Use Grid
- Use Media Queries
- Use Flexbox


### Process

- Built with
- VScode
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

What I learned Being that I'm still learning frontend development, I was able work on a few things for the first time and understand them properly. Some of the CSS properties were:

- How to use Grid
- Mixing units and using them at the appropriate time
- Adding media queries
- More knowledge on divs, their height and width
- Use HTML semantics
- Making site compatile to other device resolutions

There are still other things i need to learn and I'll still need to keep practicing.
